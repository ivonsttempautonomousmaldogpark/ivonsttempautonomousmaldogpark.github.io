# Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park


This used to be a house.

then it was a vacant lot.

Small dogs in this city have had a tough summer.
small dogs in this city have tough lives. Small dogs 
need a place to chill.

## We do hereby declare the formerly vacant lot on the northwest corner of the intersection of SE 13th Avenue and SE Ivon Street to heretofore be known as the Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park

The uneven terrain and loose ground cover of the Ivon Street Temporary
Autonomous Small Dog Park provides
ample opportunity for frolicing, burrowing, and sniffing
all in a lovely setting 

The  Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park
is only a place if people treat it like a place. 
Open space has become a little scarce in this city 
and we should take care of what we can even if it's just
for a little while. Please try and leave the  Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park
a little nicer than it was when you got there.
