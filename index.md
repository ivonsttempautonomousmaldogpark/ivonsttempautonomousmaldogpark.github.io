# Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park

![house](house.jpg)

Tina used to live here. It was a cool old house; 
it had a little fenced in porch sticking out the side,
a *baby cage*. Tina's gone now, and the house is gone. 
It's been a vacant lot for months.

Meanwhile, small dogs across inner southeast portland
have no place to frolic. Hence the Ivon Street Temporary Autonomous Small Dog Park.

A space where little yappers are treasured.
